# Autoexam

A simple exam generator and grader written in Python with OpenCV.


## Getting Started

Currently, the only supported platform is Linux. Support for other operating systems is on it's way. ;)

To install dependencies in a Debian based Linux distribution, just run the following command as superuser:

```bash
sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-lang-spanish python-opencv \
python-jinja2 python-qrcode python-zbar python-alsaaudio python-flask
```

If you're going to use the Qt UI, 'python-qt4' is required as well.

You should also install `poppler-utils` as a temporary development dependency.

The recommended way to use Autoexam is installing it globally into your system.
You can use the provided `install.sh` script for this.

```bash
cd /path/to/autoexam
sudo ./install.sh
```

The rest of the examples in this README will assume you did this.

## How it works

You can use Autoexam both as a command line tool, or with a PyQt GUI.

### Command Line Interface

To create a new project, just type:

```bash
autoexam new 'test_name'
cd 'test_name'
```

You can define your questions database by editing the `master.txt` file. Use this file as well
to specify how many questions you'd like in your exams, and how many of each tag.

Afterwards, run the following command:

```bash
autoexam gen -c number_of_exams
```

Your exams will be generated in pdf format in the `/path/to/project/generated/last` folder.

The next step would be actually printing out the exams and torturing the students a little. :)

After you've got your answer sheets filled up, run the following command:

```bash
autoexam scan
```

At this point, you can modify the default grader sheet if needed.
It's just a text file inside the `generated` folder.

The last thing to do is to actually grade the exams. It's pretty simple:

```bash
autoexam grade
```

This will create a `grades.json` file with the results. Pretty simple, right?

GUI
---

Just run:

```
autoexam qtui
```

...and a wizard-like interface will pop up. If it is run from inside a project folder,
it will automatically be loaded. It's all pretty intuitive, so... enjoy! :)

Currently there is no UI for editing the gradersheet. It's just a text file `grader.txt` inside the generated folder, so feel free to edit it. The syntax is similar to this: [points_for_selecting:points_for_unselecting] * number_of_options. This should probably get more user friendly in the near future.

### Contributing

Whether it's code, ideas, suggestions, or whatever, contributions are more than welcome!

Or if you feel adventurous enough, you can always clone/fork the project
and then do a pull request. ;)
